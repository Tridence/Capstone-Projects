### **Web Application Project:**

You are required to create an authentication system wherein a user can log in to see the next page of the site. The credentials when a user creates a new account get stored in a database, open source your project in any version  control system of your choice, host it in any web hosting service provider and write a blog post/article  to document  it.

**You final application/system must have all the features a login authentication system should have, these features  are:** 

1. Users can log in only if their credentials are present in the database.
 
2. Without logging in, the user cannot go to the next page, even using that particular page's routes.
 
3. When logged in, the user can go to other pages using routes.
 
4. After clicking on logout, the user cannot go to the next page again using routes.

5. If the email or username already exists in the database, the user will not create the account.

Remember to open source your project in any version control system of your choice and write a blog post/article to document it.
